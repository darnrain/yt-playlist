Main change log notes
================================

Linux v2.45 | macOS v2.45 Termux v2.45
Fixed bug, with "Enter number of music/video results."
Play SD menu and Play HD menu.
If no number entered then it would unset the default results number of 100, then no results found.
Changed Play SD menu & Play Bookmark menu video default gamma settings & limited RGB. 
Added --ignore-errors to yt-dlp results function. Sometimes there is an error message that pops up getting the results. It's not a problem just a YouTube error message.

Linux v2.44 | macOS v2.44 Termux v2.44
Added to the Play HD menu Linux and macOS.
--hwdec-extra-frames=256 
Number  of GPU frames hardware decoding should preallocate (default: see --list-options output). If this is too low, frame allocation may fail during decoding, and video frames might get dropped and/or corrupted. Setting it too high simply wastes GPU memory and  has no advantages.
Changed the gamma on the Play HD menu Linux and macOS, made it brighter with full RGB color values.
Removed from the Billboard menu.
7) 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die.
Removed from the Billboard menu.
8) Chartmasters Top Songs.

Linux v2.43 | macOS v2.43 Termux v2.43
Updated the readme.txt on macOS.
Max cache Play SD menu, YTMusic menu and Bookmark menu of 40MB.
added --vd-lavc-dr=yes to the Play HD menu and the Play SD menu, Linux and macOS. Enable direct rendering (default: auto). If this is set to yes, the video will be decoded directly to GPU video memory (or staging buffers).  This can speed up video upload, and may help with large resolutions or slow hardware.
Added --video-output-levels=full To Linux and macOS, RGB color levels full = (0-255 per component) Play HD menu and Play SD menu.
Fixed the white apple remote on macOS. Now you press to FF and RR 5 seconds and hold for next track or prev track.
Added support for white apple remove on Linux. press to FF or RR volume already worked so did play/pause. Running on a mac mini. FF and RR only works on video when mpv is the active window.

Starting now, the latest version will be under the test directory. There is a test_change_log.txt. If you want to install it with the Automated install, change --main to --test
Keep in mind the test version may not work. You can always just reinstall the --main version.
After I get done testing it, I will upload to main.

Termux:
if [ -d ${TMPDIR}/yt-playlist/ ]; then yes|rm -R ${TMPDIR}/yt-playlist/; fi; if ! command -v git; then pkg install git; fi; git clone https://github.com/darnrain/yt-playlist.git ${TMPDIR}/yt-playlist/; chmod +x ${TMPDIR}/yt-playlist/yt-playlist-termux/install.sh; ${TMPDIR}/yt-playlist/yt-playlist-termux/install.sh --main


Linux v2.41 | macOS v2.41.1 Termux v2.40.1
Fixed HW GPU on Play SD menu macos.

8) Max cache size 640MB.
9) Max cache size 1280MB.
10) Max cache size 2560MB.

Linux v2.40.1 | macOS v2.40.1 | Termux v2.40.1
Small update, uninstall.sh will now remove ~/.config/yt-playlist/scripts/ 

Linux v2.40 | macOS v2.40 | Termux v2.40
I was able to speed up yt-dlp by adding the argument -N4
Added a cache wait time to the Play HD menu of 120 seconds. This should help smooth out the starting of hd videos.

Linux v2.39 | macOS v2.39.1 | Termux v2.39
Fixed macOS Automated installer.

Linux v2.39 | macOS v2.39 | Termux v2.39
macOS version is out of beta now. I got it working as good as it's going to get.
Changed the way cache works on the Play HD menu. Before it was just reading ahead a max size of MB. Now mpv will read ahead for a max 600 seconds up to 2GB. The back cache buffer is set at 256MB.
So this change should decrease the ram usage. Also changed the way cache works on the Play SD menu and Play Bookmark menu and Play Music menu. Now video and music is set to 120 seconds read ahead. 
Changed the Automated install command for macOS version.

Linux v2.38.1 | macOS v0.22.2 | Termux v2.38
Fixed the internal hardware gpu on macOS.

Linux v2.38.1 | macOS v0.22.1 | Termux v2.38
Changed --hwdec=auto-safe to --hwdec=auto on Linux.
This will enable HW gpu even if the GPU is not listed in the safe database.

Changed --hwdec=auto--safe --vo=gpu to --hwdec=auto --vo=libmpv on macOS beta.
The HW gpu was not enabled, now it is.

Linux v2.38 | macOS v0.22 | Termux v2.38
Removed the check to make sure yt-playlist is not loaded before installing yt-playlist. It was just causing too many issues with macOS beta. So I thought I would just remove it from all the installers.

Linux v2.37.2 | macOS v0.21 | Termux v2.37
Updated the Linux auto dependencies.txt file to include:
If you get an error message:
"chmod: cannot access '/usr/bin/yt-dlp': No such file or directory"
Then copy and paste again, yt-dlp did not get downloaded.

Linux v2.37.1 | macOS v0.21 | Termux v2.37
Added support for zsh shell to just press y to load yt-playlist on Linux.

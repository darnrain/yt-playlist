Change log notes
================================

Linux v2.46 | macOS v2.46 Termux v2.46
Added the notes menu. You can type notes at the main menu to read change log notes main and test.
Updated the readme.txt Automated install and Manual uninstall. Changed yes|rm -R /tmp/yt-playlist/ to rm -rf /tmp/yt-playlist/
Changed Offline install to Manual install in the readme.txt.
Fixed error message on results function.
Fixed error message on Play HD menu.
Fixing these errors it looks like the Play HD menu now downloads the video a lot faster.
Changed the RGB color on the Play SD menu to full gamma 2.2
Updated the Check for update option to include main and test.

Linux v2.45 | macOS v2.45 Termux v2.45
Fixed bug, with "Enter number of music/video results."
Play SD menu and Play HD menu.
If no number entered then it would unset the default results number of 100, then no results found.
Changed Play SD menu & Play Bookmark menu video default gamma settings & limited RGB. 
Added --ignore-errors to yt-dlp results function. Sometimes there is an error message that pops up getting the results. It's not a problem just a YouTube error message.

Linux v2.44 | macOS v2.44 Termux v2.44
Added to the Play HD menu Linux and macOS.
--hwdec-extra-frames=256 
Number  of GPU frames hardware decoding should preallocate (default: see --list-options output). If this is too low, frame allocation may fail during decoding, and video frames might get dropped and/or corrupted. Setting it too high simply wastes GPU memory and  has no advantages.
Changed the gamma on the Play HD menu Linux and macOS, made it brighter with full RGB color values.
Removed from the Billboard menu.
7) 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die.
Removed from the Billboard menu.
8) Chartmasters Top Songs.

Linux v2.43 | macOS v2.43 Termux v2.43
Updated the readme.txt on macOS.
Max cache Play SD menu, YTMusic menu and Bookmark menu of 40MB.
added --vd-lavc-dr=yes to the Play HD menu and the Play SD menu, Linux and macOS. Enable direct rendering (default: auto). If this is set to yes, the video will be decoded directly to GPU video memory (or staging buffers).  This can speed up video upload, and may help with large resolutions or slow hardware.
Added --video-output-levels=full To Linux and macOS, RGB color levels full = (0-255 per component) Play HD menu and Play SD menu.
Fixed the white apple remote on macOS. Now you press to FF and RR 5 seconds and hold for next track or prev track.
Added support for white apple remove on Linux. press to FF or RR volume already worked so did play/pause. Running on a mac mini. FF and RR only works on video when mpv is the active window.

Starting now, the latest version will be under the test directory. There is a test_change_log.txt. If you want to install it with the Automated install, change --main to --test
Keep in mind the test version may not work. You can always just reinstall the --main version.
After I get done testing it, I will upload to main.

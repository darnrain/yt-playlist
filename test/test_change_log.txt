Linux v2.46.3 | macOS v2.46.3 Termux v2.46.3
Fixed error message on results function.

Moved all three to main.

Linux v2.45.6_test | macOS v2.45.6_test Termux v2.45.6_test

to Play SD menu Linux and macOS. Same as the Play HD menu.

Linux v2.45.1_test | macOS v2.45.1_test Termux v2.45.1_test
Fixed bug, with "Enter number of music/video results."

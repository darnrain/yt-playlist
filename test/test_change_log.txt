Linux v2.45.1_test | macOS v2.45.1_test Termux v2.45.1_test
Fixed bug, with "Enter number of music/video results."
Play SD menu and Play HD menu.
If no number endered then it would unset the default results number of 100, then no results found.

Linux v2.45.2_test | macOS v2.45.2_test Termux v2.45.1_test
Added --gamma=2.2 
to Play SD menu Linux and macOS. Same as the Play HD menu.

Linux v2.45.3_test | macOS v2.45.3_test Termux v2.45.1_test
On second thought I think I will leave the Play SD menu video at the default with no gamma settings, just in case yt-playlist is ran on a raspberry pi that does not support gamma.

Changed the max volume on the dynamic audio normalizer.

Linux v2.61.5_test | macOS v2.61.5_test | Termux v2.61.5_test
I decided to go with subwoofer v3, I added the dynamic audio normalizer to all of the audio effects.
I tweaked the dynamic audio normalizer, it was increasing the volume too much to the point it was making audio sound bad.

Linux v2.61.4_test | macOS v2.61.4_test | Termux v2.61.4_test
Added:
Custom subwoofer + treble boost v3
I removed the set volume on the input and placed the dynamic audio normalizer as the input volume control. It's more like v1 but with a dynamic audio normalizer.

Linux v2.60 | macOS v2.60 | Termux v2.60
Moved to main.
Just a little update, how I fixed the subwoofer + treble boost was, I lowered the volume of the incoming stream before it gets to the filter. Then I just had to find the perfect settings. I knew this subwoofer filter had potential.

Linux v2.60.2_test | macOS v2.60.2_test | Termux v2.60.2_test
I found the perfect custom subwoofer + treble boost settings.
I think I will move this version main, to lock it in.
sub boost   = 4.3 
Sub cutoff  = 120 
Treble gain = +2.7 
Treble freq = 2850 

Linux v2.60.1_test | macOS v2.60.1_test | Termux v2.60.1_test
I did a little testing in audacity. Found these settings work best for the custom subwoofer + treble boost. If you want less treble lower the treble gain.
Example:
sub boost   = 3
Sub cutoff  = 100
Treble gain = +2
Treble freq = 2650

Fixed the Audio effects menu disable number was incorrect.

"An exciter is used to produce high sound that is not present in the original signal. This is done by creating harmonic distortions of the signal which are restricted in range and added to the original signal. An Exciter raises the upper end of an audio signal without simply raising the higher frequencies like an equalizer would do to create a more "crisp" or "brilliant" sound."

Linux v2.55.10_test | macOS v2.55.10_test | Termux v2.55.10_test
Changed the normalization from loudnorn to dynaudnorm.

Dynamic Audio Normalizer.

This filter applies a certain amount of gain to the input audio in order to bring its peak magnitude to a target level (e.g. 0 dBFS). However, in contrast to more "simple" normalization algorithms, the Dynamic Audio Normalizer *dynamically* re-adjusts the gain factor to the input audio. This allows for applying extra gain to the "quiet" sections of the audio while avoiding distortions or clipping the "loud" sections. In other words: The Dynamic Audio Normalizer will "even out" the volume of quiet and loud sections, in the sense that the volume of each section is brought to the same target level. Note, however, that the Dynamic Audio Normalizer achieves this goal *without* applying "dynamic range compressing". It will retain 100% of the dynamic range *within* each section of the audio file. 

Linux v2.55.9_test | macOS v2.55.9_test | Termux v2.55.9_test

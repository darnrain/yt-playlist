This is the test folder, I make the latest changes to yt-playlist. You are welcome to install the test version. Just keep in mind that it may not work as expected. You can always downgrade back to the main version.

Automated install: Change --main to --test to install the test version.

Manual install: sudo chmod +x ./install.sh; ./install.sh

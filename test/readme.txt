This is the test folder, the latest updates to yt-playlist. I will upload and package to main when finished. You should consider this beta. It may not work as expected. You are welcome to install test, if anything you can always downgrade back to main.

Automated install: You can change --main to --test to install the test version.

Offline install: sudo chmod +x ./install.sh: ./install.sh

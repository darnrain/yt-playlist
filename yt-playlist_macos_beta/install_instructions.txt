This is in the beta testing stages. Things may not work as they should. I was only able to test yt-playlist on macos big sur, as I have a 2014 mac mini and can not update past that version.

v0.6
Got all menus working, but the sleep timer. This version you will need to delete all your history and favorites if you have a lower beta version installed.

rm -R ${HOME}/.config/yt-playlist/

reinstall the dependencies, I added a new one gnu-sed then install the new yt-playlist version.


Install:
Install brew first.
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"; brew update

Install the dependencies:
brew install curl nano unzip mpv fx gnu-sed terminal-notifier ffmpeg fzf socat python3 python-mutagen

download yt-playlist:
git clone https://github.com/darnrain/yt-playlist.git
cd yt-playlist/yt-playlist_macos_beta/
sudo chmod +x ./install.sh
./install.sh

run yt-playlist:
yt-playlist

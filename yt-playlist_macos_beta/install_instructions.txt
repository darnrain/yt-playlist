yt-playlist is in beta on macOS, however v0.7 seems to be running good. I was only able to test yt-playlist on macos big sur, as I have a 2014 mac mini and can not update past that version.

v0.6 or lower will need to delete all your history and favorites. Highter than v0.6 you do not have to do this.

rm -R ${HOME}/.config/yt-playlist/

If you have yt-playlist v0.7 or lower installed start at step #2.

If you are installing for the first time start at step #1.


1. Install:
Install brew first.
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"; brew update

2. Install the dependencies:
brew install curl nano unzip mpv fx gnu-sed coreutils terminal-notifier ffmpeg fzf socat python3 python-mutagen

3. download yt-playlist:
git clone https://github.com/darnrain/yt-playlist.git
cd yt-playlist/yt-playlist_macos_beta/
sudo chmod +x ./install.sh
./install.sh

4. type y to run yt-playlist. You only need to do this one time.
echo "alias y='yt-playlist'" >> ${HOME}/.bash_profile; source ${HOME}/.bash_profile

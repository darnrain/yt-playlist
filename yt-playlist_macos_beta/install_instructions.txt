This is in the beta testing stages. Things may not work as they should. I was only able to test yt-playlist on macos big sur, as I have a 2014 mac mini and can not update past that version.

Known issues:
Get channel playlist do not work.
Will not play a channel in the Play SD menu and Bookmark SD menu.
Sleep timer does not work.
All save and delete menus do not work.
You need to enable terminal-notifier notifications on macos before you can get notifications.
You will need to manually delete.

yt-playlist is in beta on macos, however v0.7 seems to be running good. I was only able to test yt-playlist on macos big sur, as I have a 2014 mac mini and can not update past that version.

v0.6 or lower delete all your history and favorites. Highter than v0.6 you do not have to do this.

rm -R ${HOME}/.config/yt-playlist/

If yt-playlist already installed, skip number 1. to go 2.

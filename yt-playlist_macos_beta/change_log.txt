v0.2
Added notifications to macos via terminal-notifier
To get them working you need to give permissions to terminal-notifier.

Disabled some menus that are known not to work with macos at this time.

v0.3
disabled some more menus that are not working on macos. All the save or delete menus do not work at this time.
Macos is BSD based and Linux is well Linux based. Some of the commands are diffrent.

v0.4
Fixed terminal-notifier.

v0.5
Everything works as far as I can tell, but Sleep timer, update and all the delete menus.

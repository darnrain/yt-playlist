v0.2
Added notifications to macos via terminal-notifier
To get them working you need to give permissions to terminal-notifier.

Disabled some menus that are known not to work with macos at this time.

v0.3
disabled some more menus that are not working on macos. All the save or delete menus do not work at this time.
Macos is BSD based and Linux is well Linux based. Some of the commands are diffrent.

v0.4
Fixed terminal-notifier.

v0.5
Everything works as far as I can tell, but Sleep timer, update and all the delete menus.

v0.6
Got all menus working, but the sleep timer. This version you will need to delete all your history and favorites if you have a lower beta version installed.

rm -R ${HOME}/.config/yt-playlist/

Then run this command to update.

brew install curl nano unzip mpv fx gnu-sed terminal-notifier ffmpeg fzf socat python3 python-mutagen

Then install the new yt-playlist version.

So as far as getting the sleep timer working, that will take a little thinking, macos does not have pulseaudio.

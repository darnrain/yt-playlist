Change log notes
================================

v2.5
Fixed an issue with saving favorites when playing music/video.
Fixed issue with the argument --title
Changed the quit commands on Main menu back to q/Q
Changed quit question back to y/Y
I was thinking that might be too many letters to press and quit accidentally.

v2.4
A number of changes in this version.
Updated the code that downloads audio and video in real time also save bookmark.

Quit Main menu commands:
q/Q/x/exit/quit
Quit question commands:
y/Y/x/exit/quit

Added a new command line argument
Desktop and terminal
notifications get
artist and title        --title

FF, RR and Play/Pause will now show in the terminal and desktop notifications. Uses notify-send, if notify-send is not found yt-playlist will default back to terminal notifications only.

Updated the --help

v2.3
There a typo. quit? (y/N)? Changed to Quit? [y/N] I know it's a little thing but it was bugging me.

v2.2
I am always pressing q when I want to press 1 for the Play SD menu. So I have added a yes or no question when you press q to quit.

v2.1
Check internet status is now in the debug menu. Type debug at the main menu to access it. Renamed Billboard charts to Billboard charts menu.

v2.0
Major update. Added a new menu to the Main Menu, Billboard charts menu. Removed Billboard Hot 100 from the YTMusic menu.

v1.54
Updated Billboard hot 100 in the YTMusic menu. It is now using curl instead of wget to download the json file. Removed wget from the auto dependencies install.

v1.53
Updated the dependencies.txt. I updated the debian based dependencies install for removing yt-dlp and youtube-dl.

v1.52
Updated the dependencies.txt. There was an error in the commands for removing the old yt-dlp and youtube-dl on arch linux. Also added pipx to uninstall yt-dlp and youtube-dl. The commands in dependencies.txt will download the latest yt-dlp version from github.com and install it.

v1.51
Default audio format is now opus for the YTMusic menu. Youtube Music is not throttled so it makes sense to use the best audio format by default.

v1.50
Changed the theme on fx, YTMusic menu option number 8. The auto dependencies install, you now have to say yes to install and to uninstall yt-dlp and youtube-dl. Added This command requires you to type in your password for sudo, for all the command that require sudo.

v1.49
Added new command line arguments Termux/Linux versions
yt-playlist --play_pause
yt-playlist --next
yt-playlist --prev

Now it should be easy to setup your media keys to control yt-playlsit. Works on all Play menus. The Play HD menu you can only play/pause.

Updated yt-playlist --help

I am going to include a change_log.txt file now with the zip file and main repo, so everyone can keep updated on all the changes I am making.

Because of this update, I have removed the mpv_commands.txt file.

Old depreciated commands

Play/Pause command.
echo cycle pause | socat - "/tmp/mpvsocket"

Next track command.
echo playlist-next | socat - "/tmp/mpvsocket"

Prev track command.
echo playlist-prev | socat - "/tmp/mpvsocket"

v1.48
Updated yt-playlist --help

v1.47
Changed how resume playback works.
Play music/video then if you want to save the playback position and quit press "shift-q".
When you want to resume from that saved playback position enable resume playback, then play the music/video.
If you just want to quit music/video with out saving the playback position, press "q".
You can save to the bookmarks and then press "shift-q" to save the playback position, then resume playback from the bookmarks.
Resume playback and save playback position only will work in the Play SD menu and Bookmark SD menu.

Updated the help to include this info, the abridged version.

v1.46
Updated the Play SD menu option number 11 to say Enter number of music/video results. From Enter number of video results.

You now have to enable resume playback for the playback position to be saved when you quit watching music/video on the Play SD menu and Bookmark SD menu, before the playback position would be saved even if you did not have resume playback enabled. This way your playback position will not get overwritten if you forget to enable resume playback.

v1.45
Updated the Termux and Linux help to include that you can press enter for next track. Updated the mpv_commands.txt

How to update yt-dlp for yt-playlist.
yt-dlp, mpv and fzf are the core dependencies for yt-playlist, so keeping them up to date is a good idea.

Arch and Debian based linux can always upgrade to the latest version of yt-dlp by running the auto dependencies in dependencies.txt

Termux can update by running this command:
pip install --upgrade yt-dlp

macOS becasue yt-dlp just got released 9-23-23 it may take two days or so for mac to get an update.
brew upgrade

Check version:
yt-dlp --version

After you upgrade yt-dlp you will need to restart your computer, or exit Termux and open it again for yt-playlist to work.
